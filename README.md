# 🤳 Simple Real-Time Face Detector (OpenCV)
This is a minimalist Python script leveraging OpenCV and Haar Cascades for real-time face detection via webcam. It initializes the camera, processes the video feed frame-by-frame, and draws a green bounding box around any detected faces.

The project requires the cv2 library and the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file to be present in the same directory as the script. Run the script from your terminal and press the 'Esc' key (ASCII 27) to gracefully exit the application and release the camera resources.
